# Poverty Level Pedictor
What is it?

In this project we are trying to predict the poverty level of a household in CostaRica based on the attributes like # of persons living in the house, education level of people living in a house, the type of house, etc.

How I did this?

Initially I cleande the dataset by merging few columns which indicated the same value, by removing redundant columns, by discarding the columns which seemed irrelevant. Then I trained the dataset on four different models using sklearn and keras packages. Then tested the model and achieved an accuracy of 92% on lightGBM.

How to run this?
Run the notebook file on jupyter notebook to view the results.
